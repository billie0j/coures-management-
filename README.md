## 💾 Database Schema

The system uses a single SQLite table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    age INTEGER NOT NULL,
    courses TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### Field Descriptions:
- **student_id**: Unique identifier (Primary Key)
- **name**: Student's full name
- **age**: Student's age (positive integer)
- **courses**: Comma-separated list of enrolled courses

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Adding a New Student
1. Navigate to "Add Student" from the main menu
2. Fill in all required fields:
   - **Student ID**: Must be unique (e.g., STU001, 2024-CS-001)
   - **Name**: Student's full name
   - **Age**: Positive integer
   - **Courses**: Comma-separated list (e.g., "Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry")
3. Click "Add Student" to save

### Viewing All Students
1. Click "View Students" to see all records
2. Use the search box to filter students by name, ID, or courses
3. Click action buttons to update courses or delete students

### Searching for a Student
1. Go to "Search Student"
2. Enter the exact Student ID
3. View detailed information if found
4. Access quick actions (update/delete) directly from results

### Updating Student Courses
1. From the student list or search results, click the edit button
2. Modify the courses in the text area
3. Use suggested courses for quick additions
4. Save changes

### Deleting a Student
1. Click the delete button next to any student
2. Confirm deletion in the popup dialog
3. Student record will be permanently removed

## 🔧 Data Structures Implementation

As required by the assignment, the system uses **dictionaries and lists** for data processing:

### Student Data Processing
```python
def process_student_data(students_raw):
    students_list = []
    for student in students_raw:
        student_dict = {
            'student_id': student['student_id'],
            'name': student['name'],
            'age': student['age'],
            'courses': student['courses'].split(',') if student['courses'] else []
        }
        students_list.append(student_dict)
    return students_list
```

### Key Data Structure Usage:
- **Dictionaries**: Store individual student records with key-value pairs
- **Lists**: Manage collections of students and course arrays
- **Processing**: Convert database rows to structured data for frontend display

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Flexible Tables**: Horizontal scrolling on small screens
- **Touch-Friendly**: Optimized button sizes and spacing

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Input Validation**: Both client-side and server-side validation
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries
- **XSS Protection**: Proper template escaping
- **CSRF Protection**: Flask's built-in security features

## 🐛 Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- **Database Errors**: Graceful handling of connection issues
- **Validation Errors**: Clear user feedback for invalid input
- **404 Errors**: Proper handling of missing students
- **Duplicate IDs**: Prevention of duplicate student IDs

## 📱 Browser Compatibility
